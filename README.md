# Classification-of-Cancer-Primary-Sites-Using-Artificial-Neural-Network-on-Somatic-Mutation-Data
In this project we use data from Catalogue of Somatic mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) to Classify the primary site of a given cancerous tumour from a patient.
Primary sites are sites where cancer starts.
Secodary sites are sites where cancer spreads to.
